<strong>Name of Project:</strong> GameShape (working title)

Project's Purpose or Goal: GameShape will allow users to review video games with a more positive and multivariate approach than traditional rating systems. Users will pick three traits from a list of 8 that they think the game does best. The aggregate data from these "votes" will be displayed in a radar graph that makes a unique shape displaying the game's average best traits. This is aiming to flatten the bias and negativity when comparing games across genres and to give video game fans a chance to step back and evaluate why they love games; as opposed to assigning them arbitrary values.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Users will need to be able to authenticate their identity
- Users will need to be able to access a game's page and submit a review form for that game.
- Users will need to be able to see the aggregated data for that game (by percentage) in a radar graph format

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.


- React JS front end
- Node JS back end
- Firebase 

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Users should be able to submit blurbs for the top traits of the game they are reviewing (tweet-length reviews), can be left blank however
- Users should be able to click on a category in the game's review page to see all blurbs for that trait (i.e. all reviews for the game's story)
- The program should tally all of the user's votes over multiple reviews and create a radar graph for their own individual tastes, so players can see trends in traits they typically enjoy
- Users should be able to see their own radar graph next to or overlapped with individual game radar graphs to see how much overlap there is
- Users should be able to click on a recommendation tab to see games that have the most overlap with their own game shape.
- Users should be able to search games by genre to see a list of multiple radar graphs in a particular genre

 What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- AnyChart JS chart library (definitely MVP)
- Games DB API (for scalability, though I can hard code new game objects as well. This would not be MVP)

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I am currently unsure which approach to take to selecting a front end/back end as we've learned so many. I might change my mind but I am aiming to do this project in react. I also wanted to list the current game traits I'm thinking about just for the fun of it, as I've been polling my friends and narrowing the list down. Thank you!
